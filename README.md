# nasa-app
This is a small app to allow users to search for images on Nasas database using API calls. I made this app to teach myself Python 3, PyQt5 and how to work with APIs.
This is my first functional app that wasn't following a tutorial so the code is probably terrible but this is how we learn and improve! :D
